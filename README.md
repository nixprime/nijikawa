Introduction
============

This repository contains source code for an implementation of a simple
architectural simulator consisting of an extremely simple, memory trace-driven
out-of-order core model attached to a simple DRAM model.

Program Description
===================

Each program simulates 100 million cycles of execution of the trace "comm1"
included with [USIMM v1.3](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/jwac12/). The core
model, which is extremely simple, models the reorder buffer and cache hierarchy
(the trace is cache-prefiltered) of a 3.2GHz, 4-wide, 192-instruction window
out-of-order core. The memory model represents a 2-channel, 4-banks-per-channel
DDR3-1600 11-11-11-28 DRAM system, controlled by an FR-FCFS memory controller
with infinite queue depth and a lazy-open row policy.

Correct implementations should retire 243,887,974 instructions after 100
million cycles.

Results
=======

All implementations are run on a laptop with a Intel i7-2720QM proccessor, 16GB
DDR3-1333 DRAM, and a 512GB Crucial M4 SSD, running Xubuntu 12.10 x86-64.

All times are best of 5. All memory usage stats refer to peak resident set size
(since this is what would determine how much memory would actually be needed to
run some number of jobs simultaneously). Unless otherwise specified, all
execution time and memory usage percentages are specified relative to the
fastest build of the dedicated one-off C++ implementation.

C++11
-----

- GCC 4.7.2
- LOC: 513
- Build time:
    1. With "-O0 -g": 2.111s
    2. With "-O2": 2.013s
    3. With "-O3": 2.042s
- Execution time:
    1. With "-O0 -g": 24.393s
    2. With "-O2": 4.585
    3. With "-O3": 4.638
- Peak memory usage:
    1. With "-O0 -g": 1072 KB
    2. With "-O2": 1076 KB
    3. With "-O3": 1076 KB
- Between range-based `for`, type inference with `auto`, and `unique_ptr`,
  C++11 is a significant improvement over C++03.
- "Modules" through textual inclusion are still terrible, as are build times.
- Vim is nice and all, but it would be nice to have a cleaner, more
  tool-friendly language; there doesn't really seem to be a C++ IDE that can
  keep up with C++11, let alone the macro and template magic thrown around in
  Prismriver.

C#
--

- Mono 2.10.8.1
- LOC: 585
- Execution time:
    1. Boehm GC: 16.549s (360.9%)
    2. SGen GC: 9.498s (207.2%)
- Peak memory usage:
    1. Boehm GC: 6368 KB (591.8%)
    2. SGen GC: 10808 KB (1004.5%)
- The high line count is a combination of C#'s brace placement convention
  (opening braces are placed on their own line), which results in somewhat
  sparse-looking code, and the fact that the C# standard library doesn't
  provide a priority queue class.
- C# is basically just a nicer Java.

Python
------

- Python 2.7.3 (compiled with GCC 4.7.2); PyPy 1.9.0 (based on Python 2.7.2,
  compiled with GCC 4.7.0)
- LOC: 239
- Execution time:
    1. CPython: 642.868s (13739.4%)
    2. PyPy: 45.467s (971.7%)
- Peak memory usage:
    1. CPython: 4968 KB (461.7%)
    2. PyPy: 62040 KB (5765.8%)
- PyPy is the best thing to happen to Python since NumPy and co. Now if only if
  they were compatible, and PyPy supported Py3K.
- For all the flak Python gets for having meaningful whitespace, it's visually
  much cleaner than braces.
- Conceptually, explicit `self` is clean and obvious. In practice, it gets
  tedious rather quickly.
- Reference semantics mean that `[MyClass()] * n` creates an array containing
  `n` references to the *same object*. Python has the same problem as Java in
  this regard (primitive types have value semantics, everything else has
  reference semantics).

Scala
-----

- Scala 2.10.0, Oracle Java HotSpot 64-bit server VM 23.7-b01 (from JDK 7u13)
- LOC: 324
- Build time:
    1. With "-g:vars": 6.906s
    2. With "-g:none -optimise": 7.841s
- Execution time:
    1. With "-g:vars": 15.276 (326.5%)
    2. With "-g:none -optimise": 15.184 (324.5%)
- Peak memory usage: 1588 KB (147.6%)
- Finding a language with longer compile times than C++ is remarkable.
- Localized implicit conversion (e.g. from a tuple to Ordered[tuple] for the
  priority queue in `Core`) is wonderful.
- Pattern matching is very nice.
- Option types are nifty.
- In a language with mutability, `map` doesn't really seem better than foreach
  loops, and `filter` isn't much better than early `break`.
- Folding is nice. `foldLeft` and pattern matching lead to a very clear
  expression of FR-FCFS in `SimpleDram.bestRequest()`.
- Arrays of objects are initialized to null like in Java, so
  NullPointerExceptions can occur even in code exclusively using Option[] over
  null.
- Minor gripe: the conditions under which a method will be implicitly converted
  to a function to pass as a function parameter don't seem very clear, and when
  the conditions aren't met, the workaround (`_` parameter) is ugly.
